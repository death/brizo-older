<p dir="ltr" align="left"><b>Brizo</b> - <i>A Minor Greek Goddess<br>
</i><br>
She was worshipped by the women of Delos (not the men, for some odd reason) as 
the Protector of Mariners. Food offerings were set out for her in little boats 
(no fish, of course). <b>Brizo</b> was (or gave answers to) an oracle who gave 
answers in dreams about navigation and fishing matters.</p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr"><u>What is <b>Brizo</b>?</u></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>Brizo</b> is a simple IA32 decoding and formatting 
(disassembly) engine. It currently supports 80586 (including FPU), MMX, SSE, 
SSE2 and SSE3 opcodes, and two decoding modes (16/32 bit). Some stuff are not 
totally complete, yet I decided to release it - to see how much attention it 
gets.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Well, this library may not give answers about fishing 
matters, but it sure gives hints about fishy matters (hehe). It also helps 
navigating between instructions - the <b>Brizo::Decoder</b> will give you their 
length. If you think that's a lame excuse for the name <b>Brizo</b>, you're 
right. But you didn't write the library so you'll just have to put up with this 
:).<br>
<br>
<b>Brizo</b> wasn't written with speed in mind, but clarity and simplicity. It 
originally was written as a disassembly engine for a debugger.<br>
To make it clear - <b>Brizo</b> is my first attempt at writing a disassembler, 
so if it's all wrong and evil -- tell my why.</p>
